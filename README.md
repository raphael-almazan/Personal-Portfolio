# Personal-Portfolio
Personal portfolio made with vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap 5 with animations using GSAP. On the portfolio, I used the bootstrap 5 grid system layout to organize all the possible columns and rows. The whole layout of the portfolio are animated using GSAP plugins such as ScrollTrigger and ScrollTo. In addition, the layout of the portfolio are also equipped with easing animations to properly satisfy the design of my portfolio.
