# Personal-Portfolio
Personal portfolio made with vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap 5 with animations using GSAP. On the portfolio, I used the bootstrap 5 grid system layout to organize all the possible columns and rows. Each rows and columns are animated using GSAP plugins such as ScrollTrigger and ScrollTo. The layout of the portfolio are equipped with easing animations to properly satisfy the design of my portfolio.
