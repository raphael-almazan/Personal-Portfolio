# Personal-Portfolio
Responsive personal portfolio made with vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap 5 with animations using GSAP. On the portfolio, I used the bootstrap 5 grid system layout to organize all the possible columns and rows. The whole layout of the portfolio is animated using GSAP plugins such as ScrollTrigger and ScrollTo. In addition, the portfolio is also equipped with easing animations to properly satisfy the design of my portfolio. Images of my portfolio are available in the images folder!!!
